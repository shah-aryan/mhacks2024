# Overview
The Playing Cards dataset is a collection of synthetically generated cards blended into various types of backgrounds. You will be able to perform object detection to detect both number and suit of the cards.

# Training and Deployment

The playing cards model has been trained in Roboflow, available for inference on the Dataset tab.

One could also build a Card Counting model for either Black Jack or Poker using YOLOR. This is achieved using the Roboflow Platform which you can deploy the model for robust and real-time detections. You can learn more here:  https://augmentedstartups.info/YOLOR-Get-Started
